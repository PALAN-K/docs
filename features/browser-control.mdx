## Overview

PalanK provides comprehensive browser automation through natural language commands. The AI understands context and executes complex multi-step operations automatically.

## Navigation

"Go back to the previous page"
"Refresh this page"
```

### Tab Management

```text
"Open a new tab"
"Close this tab"
"Switch to the second tab"
```

## Interactions

```text
"Click the login button"
"Click on the search icon"
"Click the first product in the list"
"Double-click on the image"
```

### Typing Text

```

```

## Page Analysis

```

## Advanced Operations

### Waiting

```text
"Wait for the page to load"
"Wait until the spinner disappears"
"Wait 3 seconds"
```

### Conditional Actions

```text
"If there's a cookie banner, close it"
"Click 'Load more' until all items are visible"
"If logged in, go to dashboard; otherwise login first"
```

### Data Extraction

```text
"Extract all product names and prices"
"Get the table data as CSV"
"Copy all email addresses on this page"
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Be specific about which element you want to interact with. Instead of "click the button", say "click the blue Submit button at the bottom".
</Tip>

<Warning>
  The AI sees the page as a user would. If an element is hidden or requires scrolling, mention that in your command.
</Warning>

## Limitations

- Cannot interact with browser chrome (address bar, bookmarks)
- Cannot access cross-origin iframes with different security policies
- Some heavily protected sites may block automation
- File upload dialogs require manual interaction

## Overview

PalanK helps you automate repetitive browser tasks without writing code. Describe what you want to accomplish, and the AI handles the implementation.

## Common Automation Scenarios

### Data Collection

```text
"Go through each product on this page and collect the name, price, and rating"

"Scrape all job listings from this search result"

"Extract all email addresses from this contact page"
```

### Form Filling

```text
"Fill out this registration form:
- Name: John Doe
- Email: john@example.com
- Company: Acme Inc"

"Auto-fill shipping address with my saved information"
```

### Monitoring

```text
"Check if this product is back in stock"

"Look for any price changes on this item"

"Tell me when the status changes from 'Pending' to 'Approved'"
```

### Batch Operations

```text
"Download all images from this gallery"

"Like all posts from this user"

"Mark all unread emails as read"
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Handle Timing">
    Web pages load at different speeds. Include "wait for page to load" when navigating between pages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Respect Limits">
    Don't automate actions that violate website terms of service. Be mindful of rate limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrows-split-up-and-left" title="Break Down Tasks">
    For complex workflows, describe one step at a time rather than everything at once.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Verify Results">
    Ask the AI to confirm actions were successful: "Did the form submit correctly?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<Warning>
**Rate Limiting**: Rapid automated actions may trigger website security measures.

**Dynamic Content**: Some sites load content dynamically, requiring wait commands.

**Authentication**: The AI cannot bypass login requirements or CAPTCHAs.
</Warning>

## Privacy Considerations

<Info>
All automation runs locally on your machine. PalanK does not store or transmit your browsing data to external servers. Only your commands are sent to Claude AI for interpretation.

## Overview

PalanK is powered by Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant. This enables natural language understanding, context awareness, and intelligent decision-making for browser automation.

## Natural Language Commands

### Conversational Style

You don't need special syntax. Just describe what you want:

```text
"I need to check my email on Gmail"
"Can you help me find flights to Tokyo next month?"
"Look up the weather forecast for this weekend"
```

### Multi-Step Tasks

The AI breaks down complex requests automatically:

```text
"Log into my account, go to settings, and change my password"

AI executes:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter credentials
3. Click login
4. Find settings menu
5. Navigate to password section
6. Initiate password change
```

## Context Awareness

### Page Understanding

The AI analyzes the current page to understand:
- Page structure and layout
- Interactive elements (buttons, forms, links)
- Content and context
- User flow and navigation patterns

### Memory

Within a session, the AI remembers:
- Previous commands and results
- Information you've shared
- Errors encountered and how they were resolved

```text
User: "Go to amazon.com and search for laptop"
AI: [executes search]

User: "Now filter by price under $500"
AI: [understands context, applies filter]

User: "Click on the first result"
AI: [knows we're looking at laptops under $500]
```

## Intelligent Error Handling

### Auto-Recovery

When something goes wrong, the AI attempts to recover:

```text
Command: "Click the checkout button"

If button not visible:
- AI scrolls to find it
- Waits for page load if needed
- Reports if button doesn't exist
```

### Clear Feedback

The AI explains what it's doing and any issues:

```text
"I couldn't find a 'checkout' button. I see a 'Proceed to Cart'
button instead. Should I click that?"
```

## Supported Languages

PalanK understands commands in multiple languages:

- English
- Korean (한국어)
- Japanese (日本語)
- Chinese (中文)

- And more...
